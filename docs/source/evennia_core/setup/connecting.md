# Connecting to Evennia
Is your Evennia server started? If not, read [starting your Evennia server](evennia_core/Start-Stop-Reload).

Evennia should now be running and you can connect to it by pointing a web browser to `http://localhost:4001` 
or a MUD telnet client to `localhost:4000` (use `127.0.0.1` if your OS does not recognize `localhost`).

If you cannot access Evennia by either of the above methods, see the [Troubleshooting](related_topics/troubleshooting) page.
