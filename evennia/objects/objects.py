"""
This is the basis of the typeclass system.

The idea is have the object as a normal class with the
database-connection tied to itself through a property.

The instances of all the different object types are all tied to their
own database object stored in the 'dbobj' property.  All attribute
get/set operations are channeled transparently to the database object
as desired. You should normally never have to worry about the database
abstraction, just do everything on the TypeClass object.

That an object is controlled by a player/user is just defined by its
'user' property being set.  This means a user may switch which object
they control by simply linking to a new object's user property.

class DefaultObject(ObjectDB):
    """
    This is the root typeclass object, representing all entities
    that have an actual presence in-game. Objects generally have a
    location. They can also be manipulated and looked at. Most
    game entities you define should inherit from Object at some distance.
    Evennia defines some important subclasses of Object by default, namely
    Characters, Exits and Rooms (see the bottom of this module).

    Note that all new Objects and their subclasses *must* always be
    created using the ev.create_object() function. This is so the
    typeclass system can be correctly initiated behind the scenes.


    Object Typeclass API:

    * Available properties (only available on *initiated* typeclass objects)

     key (string) - name of object
     name (string) - same as key
     aliases (list of strings) - aliases to the object. Will be saved to
                 database as AliasDB entries but returned as strings.
     dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
     date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation
     permissions (list of strings) - list of permission strings

     player (Player) - controlling player (if any, only set together with
                      sessid below)
     sessid (int, read-only) - session id (if any, only set together with
                      player above)
     location (Object) - current location. Is None if this is a room
     home (Object) - safety start-location
     sessions (list of Sessions, read-only) - returns all sessions
                 connected to this object
     has_player (bool, read-only)- will only return *connected* players
     contents (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all objects inside
                     this object (including exits)
     exits (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all exits from this
                 object, if any
     destination (Object) - only set if this object is an exit.
     is_superuser (bool, read-only) - True/False if this user is a superuser

    * Handlers available

     locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
     db - attribute-handler: store/retrieve database attributes on this
                             self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
     ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not
                             create a database entry when storing data
     scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
     cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
     nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().

    * Helper methods (see evennia.objects.objects.py for full headers)

                          returning False, deletion is aborted. Note that
                          all objects inside a deleted object are
                          automatically moved to their <home>, they don't
                          need to be removed here.

     at_init()            called whenever typeclass is cached from
                          memory, at least once every server restart/reload

     at_server_reload()   - called before server is reloaded
     at_server_shutdown() - called just before server is fully shut down

     at_before_move(destination)    called just before moving
                                    object to the destination. If returns
                                    False, move is cancelled.
     announce_move_from(destination)  - called in old location, just before
                                        move, if obj.move_to() has
                                        quiet=False
     announce_move_to(source_location) - called in new location,

                                         has quiet=False
     at_after_move(source_location)    - always called after a move
                                         has been successfully performed.
     at_object_leave(obj, target_location)   - called when an object leaves

     at_access(result, **kwargs) - this is called with the result of an
                                   access call, along with any kwargs used
                                   for that call. The return of this
                                   method does not affect the result of the
                                   lock check.
     at_before_traverse(traversing_object) - (exit-objects only) called
                                              just before an object

        objects in self's current location or inventory is searched.
        Note: to find Players, use eg. ev.player_search.

        Inputs:

        searchdata (str or obj): Primary search criterion. Will be matched
                    against object.key (with object.aliases second) unless
                    the keyword attribute_name specifies otherwise.
                    Special strings:
                        #<num> - search by unique dbref. This is always
                                 a global search.
                        me,self - self-reference to this object
                        <num>-<string> - can be used to differentiate
                                         between multiple same-named matches
        global_search (bool): Search all objects globally. This is overruled
                              by "location" keyword.
        use_nicks (bool): Use nickname-replace (nicktype "object") on the
                          search string
        typeclass (str or Typeclass, or list of either): Limit search only
                   to Objects with this typeclass. May be a list of typeclasses
                   for a broader search.
        location (Object): Specify a location to search, if different from the
                     self's given location plus its contents. This can also
                     be a list of locations.
        attribute_name (str): Define which property to search. If set, no
                      key+alias search will be performed. This can be used to
                      search database fields (db_ will be automatically
                      appended), and if that fails, it will try to return
                      objects having Attributes with this name and value
                      equal to searchdata. A special use is to search for
                      "key" here if you want to do a key-search without
                      including aliases.
        quiet (bool) - don't display default error messages - this tells the
                      search method that the user wants to handle all errors
                      themselves. It also changes the return value type, see
                      below.
        exact (bool) - if unset (default) - prefers to match to beginning of
                      string rather than not matching at all. If set, requires
                      exact mathing of entire string.
        candidates (list of objects) - this is an optional custom list of objects
                    to search (filter) between. It is ignored if global_search
                    is given. If not set, this list will automatically be defined
                    to include the location, the contents of location and the
                    caller's contents (inventory).

        Returns:
            quiet=False (default):
                no match or multimatch:
                auto-echoes errors to self.msg, then returns None
