Convert gametime

Contrib - Griatch 2017

This is the game-dependent part of the evennia.utils.gametime module
that used to be settable from the settings file. Since this was just
a bunch of conversion routines, it is now moved to a contrib since it
is highly unlikely its use is of general game use. The utils.gametime
module deals in seconds, and you can use this contrib to convert
that to fit the calendar of your game.

Usage:
    Import and use as-is or copy this module to mygame/world and
    modify it to your needs there.

    Helper function. Creates a tuple of even dividends given a range

            number of seconds will be integer-divided by the first number in
