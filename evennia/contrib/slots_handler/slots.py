Slots Handler

This class is designed to sit on typeclassed objects and allow for other
objects to be attached to configurable slots on the handler-endowed object.

class SlotsHandler(object):
    """
    Handler for the slots system. This handler is designed to be attached to
    objects with a particular @lazy-property name, so it will be referred to as
    `.slots`, though individual games can set that however they like.

    Place on character or other typeclassed object:
    ```
    @lazy_property
    def slots(self):
        return SlotsHandler(self)
    ```

    The purpose of this handler is to sit on a "holder" typeclassed object and
    manage slots for "held" objects. The first thing that should happen is
    using `self.slots.add()` on the holder object to identify the available
    options. `.slots.delete()` can be used to delete or pop old slots.

    By default, a held object can have slots stored on it (the handler will
    check `.db.slots`, `.ndb.slots`, and `.slots` in that order), and
    `self.slots.attach()` will attempt to attach it on all of those slots (it
    should fail if it can't attach on every slot). `self.slots.drop()` will
    remove the target from any of the slots given it. Both of these methods
    have the option to be given a custom `slots` argument, which will override
    the slots on the held object.

    Using the custom `slots` in `attach()` and `drop()` provides some
    customization facility in that you can store *any* object in a slot, not
    just an object that has been set up for it.
