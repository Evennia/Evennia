        This script has two modes, RT and TB.

        The RT mode processes all actions whose endtime is less than the current
        CPU time, pops any relevant actions enqueued by these processed actions'
        owners, and finally sets the script to run again when the next action
        is due to complete.

        The TB mode of this function gives a turn action to all characters in
        the room that do not currently have an action, tells the player whose
        turn has just ended that their turn has ended, processes the earliest
        action in the room's actions list and gives that action's owner the
        turn, providing them with either 60 seconds to act (if the owner is
        a PC) or 5 seconds (if the owner is an NPC).

        In either the RT or TB mode, if no actions are present in the room's
        actions list, the function pauses the script.
