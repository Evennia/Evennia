Pathfinder

Contrib - Johnny 2018

A batteries-included abstraction for in-MUD navigation.

Builds a queryable "map" (directional graph) of all of your game's Rooms and 
Exits, even accounting for one-way travel.

Requires the `networkx` library, not included with Evennia, but only a
`pip install networkx` away.

---

DIRECTIONS:
Pathfinder provides a function to get directions (the shortest path) between any
two locations. For example, an injured NPC could request directions to the local 
hospital from the bottom of a dungeon (['up', 'east', 'up', 'north', 'north', 
'east']), or you can easily implement things like autonomous mobs or vehicles.

Mob AI can also take advantage of it to get the shortest path to their next
intended victim-- just provide the mob's location and the target's location.

LINE OF SIGHT:
Pathfinder also provides an easy way to look across multiple unobstructed rooms 
in a given direction. For example, if the next five rooms allow you to travel
'east', you can get references to all five rooms with a single 'look east' query. 
But if there is no eastern exit in the adjacent room, you won't see beyond it.

This only works if your exits are keyed by a consistent generic direction, as 
opposed to unique (high-cardinality) destination names. (i.e. 'left', 'east', 
'up', 'in', n', 'w' will work, but 'apothecary', 'dungeon', 'subway' or the like
will not). This will also not work as expected if your exits implement twisted
passage logic, where exiting a room to the east requires re-entry from the north.

That the line-of-sight query looks at a precached "map" instead of having to 
calculate the same result per user upon request makes this a much more efficient 
solution, and scales better at longer distances (like open prairies or deserts).

EXPORT:
You can export the "map" generated by the Pathfinder in JSON Graph format. 
External libraries can allow you to visualize or render your "map" in ways beyond
what a terminal can support.

Usage:

The Pathfinder class can be used like any Python object, but it is expensive to
construct and maintain, so you don't want to create it repeatedly, nor do you
want multiple instances of it floating around. These "maps" are very memory-hungry
as they grow.

Using this class directly is really only appropriate for testing and experimenta-
tion. For general usage, you'll want to use the helper Script included to create
the "map" and keep it updated.
